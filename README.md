trying to get this in my editor.

what chatgpt said;

> I'm sorry to hear that you couldn't get chatgpt to work with nix. Unfortunately, nix is a relatively new platform and chatgpt is not yet compatible with it. The developers are working hard to make sure that chatgpt is compatible with all platforms, but it may take some time before it is fully compatible with nix. In the meantime, you may want to try using other chatbot platforms that are compatible with nix.


what actually happened is that I threw the entire .el file into
the linux-config project.
which worked basically first try.
then I gave up.

there is no advantage for a seperate repository as of right now
because nobody appears to maintain this.
